                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Rather than learning something new, I was really inspired by the various interactive design examples. Interactive design is not only difficult to prototype, but I've also heard from developers that it is extremely annoying to code. It is something that I really want to explore as I truly use the bare minimum of Figma's prototype features. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was to see how interaction design can add SO MANY more creative parts to a design. Even the tiniest of interactions can be made so dynamic and fun with these interaction designs. Only familiar with static designs and knowing the tiniest amount about smart animate, I was amazed at all these designs and it made me want to further look into interaction design. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Though I really enjoyed looking at every example, I really liked the "Add to Cart Interaction" by Dannniel for Norde. It was such a fun interaction that I would have never expected for an add to cart experience. I was also extremeley impressed by the details of the shaking popup to the changes of colors. It is such a short interaction but has such immense details that I cannot even imagine desiging/coding. </p>

                                It was cool to see the designs but I wish there were words explaining the designs. </p>
