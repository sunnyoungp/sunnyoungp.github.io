				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I've always been aware of dark patterns ever since I tried to play iPhone games and they would always deceptively lead me to press into ads that I didn't want to. However, I have never been aware of the actual terminology until today. I was also fascinated to see dark patterns being used in larger brands such as Curology. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was when the article began going into the specific ways that dark patterns exist. I have seen almost all these different dark patterns in my own daily life so it was interesting to put actual names to these designs. I've specifically fallen for the Disguised Ads a lot while growing up so I was intrigued to see it pointed out. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
