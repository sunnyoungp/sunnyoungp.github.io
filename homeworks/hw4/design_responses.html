						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Coming from a design background, I've been familiar with the color wheel and using colors aesthetically. However, I realized how easy it is for designers to think about design accessibility. Though often times I make design decisions based off of aesthetics, this made me think again about ensuring that my designs are accessible. The main thing I learned from this article is not solely relying on color as I have also struggled to do this in order to consider what other methods lie outside of color cues that can inform users about a current state. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was definitely seeing the examples of how to not solely rely on color. This opened my eyes to think more about the user experience as a red outline text box will not be enough to inform a user that something is incorrect. I also LOVED that Trello had a color blind mode that uses patterns to allow users to distinguish the different labels. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power to create a web weâ€™re all proud of: an inclusive web made for and consumable by all people." </p>
						</li>
