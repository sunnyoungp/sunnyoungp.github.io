							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about the importance of font choices. There are so many different kinds of fonts and they are all used for different purposes. It is important to think about the audience that is viewing your fonts because as the article had mentioned, children would need more legibile fonts while elderly may need fonts that are larger. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when it was explaining how to determine the size of fonts. Though I am familiar with design, I still struggle with choosing font sizes and usually default to the 8px rule. Therefore it was interesting to see the Modular Scale that brings a new way for me to decide what font sizes to use. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Use this method as a starting point and then adjust sizes with your eye." 
								I thought this quote was cool because it emphasizes that in the end of the day, design is for humans and there could be a set of rules but in the end you need to take a human perspective to make a final judgement.
